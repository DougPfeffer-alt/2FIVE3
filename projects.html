            <h2><a href="https://dougpfeffer-alt.github.io/Wheel_Of_Wealth/">Wheel of Wealth</h2></a>
            <p> Final Project for the Code Fellows Code 201 class. Replicated the Wheel of Fortune game, using skillsets
                learned during class. Presented a Home Page (where user can submit their name to play), an About Us Page
                with our team, a Game Page (providing 3 rounds of gameplay), and a High Score Page using local data
                storage. The game offered 3 categories (Sports, CSS and JavaScript), and used a randomizer to assign
                dollar values for letters guessed. We also included a bankruptcy option to simulate the game further.

            <h2><a href="https://dougpfeffer-alt.github.io/bus-mall/"">Busmall</h2></a>
            <p>BusMall (similar the SkyMall) wants to do market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interest, before actually putting them into the catalog and getting the manufacturing wheels in motion. Provided a display of 3 random products, which the user could select from to indicate their preferred option. No two sets of items in a row were the same, and the survey ended with a chart rendering showing which products were favored.</p>

                    <h2><a href="https://dougpfeffer-alt.github.io/cookie-stand/"">Salmon Cookies</h2></a>
            <p>Patâ€™s Salmon Cookies, soon with franchises internationally, needs to calculate the number of cookies each location must make every day, so that it can manage its supplies, inventory and baking schedule. Provided an option to add a new store, which would then populate a chart showing average cookie sales per hour, a total sales per store, and a total corporate sales for the day.</p>
